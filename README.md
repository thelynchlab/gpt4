GPT Answer
A 40-year-old man presented with a 12-month history of an eruption affecting both hands. It improved when he went on holiday, but did not go away. He had worked as a bricklayer for 20 years. On examination, he had a chronic dermatitis affecting the palms and backs of both hands. He was referred for patch testing. Which allergen is most likely to prove positive on patch testing? Question 1 A: cobalt chloride B: fragrance mix II C: nickel sulphate D: potassium dichromate E: thiuram mix
Answer: D - Correct

Elaboration: Potassium dichromate is a common allergen found in cement, which the patient would have been frequently exposed to as a bricklayer for 20 years. Chronic dermatitis on the hands is a common symptom of contact allergy to potassium dichromate. The improvement of the condition during the holiday, when the patient was likely not working with cement, also supports this conclusion.
A 50-year-old woman presented with a 2-year history of a solitary, asymptomatic lesion on her left thigh. On examination, the lesion was pink, dome-shaped and measured 1 × 1 cm. The lesion demonstrated a fine collarette of scale. The lesion was excised and sent for histopathological analysis. The pathologist reported that there were some psoriasiform features in the epidermis. What is the most likely diagnosis? Question 2 A: clear cell acanthoma B: keratoacanthoma C: pilomatricoma D: seborrhoeic keratosis E: trichilemmoma
Answer: A - Correct

Clear cell acanthoma is the most likely diagnosis for this patient. It is a benign epidermal tumor that typically presents as a solitary, asymptomatic, pink or red, dome-shaped lesion with a fine collarette of scale. The lesion is usually found on the lower extremities, as in this case. Histopathological analysis often shows psoriasiform features in the epidermis, which is consistent with the pathologist's report. The other options (keratoacanthoma, pilomatricoma, seborrheic keratosis, and trichilemmoma) do not match the clinical presentation and histopathological findings as closely as clear cell acanthoma.
A 53-year-old woman was referred with an ulcer on her leg. She had noted the rapid development of a very painful ulcer during the previous 3 weeks. She recalled having had a small blister following minor trauma before the ulceration had appeared. On examination, there was a deep ulcer with undermined borders on the lateral aspect of her left mid-calf that measured 8 × 10 cm. There was surrounding erythema and regional lymphadenopathy. She had no signs of arterial or venous insufficiency. Urinalysis was normal. A skin biopsy taken from the ulcer margin demonstrated a dense diffuse neutrophilic infiltrate with a mixture of lymphocytes, plasma cells, histiocytes and occasional foreign body giant cells, extending to the subcutis. Investigations: haemoglobin 146 g/L (115–165) white cell count 14.2 × 109/L (4.0–11.0) platelet count 450 × 109/L (150–400) antinuclear antibodies negative ANCA negative syphilis serology negative colonoscopy normal culture for bacteria, mycobacteria and fungi negativeWhat is the most appropriate therapeutic option? Question 3 A: dapsone B: flucloxacillin C: infliximab D: minocycline E: prednisolone
Answer: A - Incorrect

The most appropriate therapeutic option for this patient is dapsone. The clinical presentation and histopathological findings are suggestive of pyoderma gangrenosum, which is a rare, inflammatory skin disorder characterized by rapidly progressing, painful ulcers with undermined borders. Dapsone is an effective treatment for pyoderma gangrenosum due to its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Other treatment options, such as corticosteroids (prednisolone) and immunosuppressive agents (infliximab), may also be considered in some cases, but dapsone is generally the first-line treatment. Flucloxacillin and minocycline are antibiotics and would not be appropriate for treating an inflammatory skin disorder like pyoderma gangrenosum.
A 53-year-old man presented with a 3-month history of sore areas in his mouth and on his scalp. He was otherwise well and was not taking any regular medication. On examination, there were erosions on the buccal mucosa and crusted lesions on his scalp and upper back. A skin biopsy demonstrated epidermal acantholysis and a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate in the dermis. Direct immunofluorescence showed intercellular deposition of IgG and complement C3 in the epidermis. What is the most likely autoantigen? Question 4 A: collagen VII B: desmoglein-1 C: desmoglein-3 D: desmoplakin E: laminin-332
Answer: C- Correct

The patient's presentation of sore areas in the mouth, scalp, and upper back, along with the skin biopsy findings of epidermal acantholysis and a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate in the dermis, are suggestive of pemphigus vulgaris. Pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune blistering disease characterized by the production of autoantibodies against desmoglein-3, a protein found in desmosomes that helps to maintain cell adhesion in the skin and mucous membranes. The direct immunofluorescence findings of intercellular deposition of IgG and complement C3 in the epidermis further support this diagnosis.
A 17-year-old girl presented with acne. She had been taking co-cyprindiol (cyproterone acetate 2 mg, ethinylestradiol 35 micrograms) for acne management for the past 2 years. On examination, she had facial papules, cysts, comedones and scarring. Her fasting lipids and liver function tests were within the normal range. What is the most important issue to discuss if considering treatment with systemic isotretinoin? Question 5 A: alcohol consumption B: cheilitis C: drug interaction D: keloid risk E: teratogenic risk
Answer: E - Correct

The most important issue to discuss if considering treatment with systemic isotretinoin is the teratogenic risk. Isotretinoin is a highly effective treatment for severe acne, but it is also known to cause severe birth defects if taken during pregnancy. Therefore, it is crucial to discuss the potential risks to a developing fetus and the importance of using effective contraception during treatment and for at least one month after discontinuing the medication. Additionally, regular pregnancy tests should be conducted to ensure that the patient is not pregnant while taking isotretinoin.
A 23-year-old man was referred for genetic counselling because of non-itchy dryness of his skin; this had been present since birth. He was otherwise well. His maternal grandfather had a similar skin condition. His wife was pregnant with their first child. On examination, he had pronounced light-brown scaling of his skin, most prominent on the extensor surfaces of the upper arms and legs with less marked changes in the flexures. What is the probability that the child will express ichthyosis? Question 6 A: <1% B: 25% C: 50% D: 75% E: 100%
Answer B: 25% - Incorrect

The man's skin condition is likely to be an autosomal dominant form of ichthyosis, given that his maternal grandfather also had a similar condition. This means that he has a 50% chance of passing the affected gene to his child. However, since the wife does not have the condition, she is unlikely to carry the affected gene. Therefore, the probability of their child inheriting the affected gene from both parents is very low.

The probability of the child expressing ichthyosis would be 25%, as there is a 50% chance of the father passing the affected gene and a 50% chance of the mother passing the normal gene. The possible combinations of genes the child could inherit are:

1. Father's affected gene + Mother's normal gene (25% chance) - Child will express ichthyosis
2. Father's normal gene + Mother's normal gene (25% chance) - Child will not express ichthyosis
3. Father's affected gene + Mother's affected gene (very low chance) - Child will express ichthyosis
4. Father's normal gene + Mother's affected gene (very low chance) - Child will not express ichthyosis

Since the chances of the mother carrying the affected gene are very low, we can assume that the probability of the child expressing ichthyosis is 25%.
A 27-year-old man presented with a 2-month history of an enlarging, red nodule on his left big toe. The lesion was uncomfortable when he walked. On examination, there was an inflamed nodule, 8 mm in diameter. The lesion was excised and the histology was examined (see image). What is the most likely diagnosis? Question 7 A: abscess B: amelanotic melanoma C: eccrine poroma D: myxoid cyst E: pyogenic granuloma
Answer: E: pyogenic granuloma - Correct

Pyogenic granuloma is the most likely diagnosis in this case. It is a benign vascular lesion that commonly presents as a rapidly growing, red, and sometimes painful nodule. It can occur at any age but is more common in young adults. The lesion may bleed easily and can be found on various parts of the body, including the toes. The histology of pyogenic granuloma typically shows a proliferation of blood vessels and inflammatory cells. Treatment usually involves excision of the lesion.
A 75-year-old woman presented with a 3-year history of enlarging lesion on her back. She had multiple comorbidities. On examination, there was a 4-cm-diameter, erythematous, scaly patch. A punch biopsy showed superficial basal cell carcinoma. It was decided that she would be treated with imiquimod 5% cream. What is the recommended treatment regimen? Question 8 A: alternate days for 4 weeks B: daily for 3 weeks C: daily for 6 weeks D: five times per week for 6 weeks E: three times per week for 8 weeks
Answer: E - incorrect

The recommended treatment regimen for imiquimod 5% cream is E: three times per week for 8 weeks.

Imiquimod 5% cream is a topical immunomodulator used to treat superficial basal cell carcinoma. The standard regimen involves applying the cream to the affected area three times per week (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) for a total of 8 weeks. This treatment schedule allows for the activation of the immune system to target and destroy the cancerous cells while minimizing side effects and irritation to the surrounding skin.
A 62-year-old man presented with a rapidly enlarging nodule on his scalp. He had undergone a renal transplant 15 years previously. He was taking prednisolone, azathioprine and ciclosporin. On examination, there was a purple lesion measuring 2 cm in diameter that was tender, but not ulcerated. There was no lymphadenopathy. A skin biopsy showed features of Merkel cell carcinoma. Which virus family is most likely to be associated with this tumour? Question 9 A: herpesvirus B: papillomavirus C: polyomavirus D: poxvirus E: retrovirus
Answer: C - Correct

Merkel cell carcinoma is most likely to be associated with the polyomavirus family, specifically the Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV). This virus has been found in a significant proportion of Merkel cell carcinoma cases and is thought to play a role in the development of the tumor. The immunosuppressive medications the patient is taking for his renal transplant may have increased his risk for developing this virus-associated cancer.
A 5-year-old boy presented with a history of recurrent blistering on his feet, which had begun in early infancy as soon as he had started to walk, and was worse in the summer. There was a similar history of blistering in his mother and maternal grandfather. A diagnosis of epidermolysis bullosa was suspected. In what molecule is the most likely primary structural defect? Question 10 A: beta-4 integrin B: bullous pemphigoid antigen 180 C: desmoglein-1 D: keratin 5 E: laminin-332
The most likely primary structural defect in this case is in keratin 5 (Answer D) - Correct

Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a group of inherited skin disorders characterized by blistering of the skin in response to minor trauma or friction. The most common form of EB is epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS), which primarily affects the basal keratinocytes of the epidermis. EBS is usually caused by mutations in the genes encoding keratin 5 (KRT5) or keratin 14 (KRT14), which are essential for the structural integrity of the basal keratinocytes. Mutations in these genes lead to the weakening of the keratin filament network, making the skin more susceptible to blistering.

The other molecules listed are associated with different skin disorders:

A: Beta-4 integrin is associated with junctional epidermolysis bullosa, another subtype of EB that affects the dermal-epidermal junction.

B: Bullous pemphigoid antigen 180 (BP180) is associated with bullous pemphigoid, an autoimmune blistering disease that affects the dermal-epidermal junction.

C: Desmoglein-1 is associated with pemphigus foliaceus, an autoimmune blistering disease that affects the desmosomes in the upper layers of the epidermis.

E: Laminin-332 is associated with junctional epidermolysis bullosa, another subtype of EB that affects the dermal-epidermal junction.
An 82-year-old man presented with a 3-month history of an enlarging crusted area on the vertex of his scalp, from which the crust was removed (see image). The area had been exudative. His scalp was not painful but was tender to touch. In the past, he had been treated for actinic keratoses. A punch biopsy showed evidence of solar elastosis, mild dysplasia and a marked inflammatory reaction. What is the most likely diagnosis of the ulcerated area? Question 11 A: basal cell carcinoma B: erosive pustular dermatosis C: pemphigus foliaceus D: pemphigus vulgaris E: squamous cell carcinoma in situ
Answer : B: erosive pustular dermatosis - Correct

Erosive pustular dermatosis is the most likely diagnosis for the ulcerated area in this 82-year-old man with a history of actinic keratoses and a 3-month history of an enlarging crusted area on his scalp. The presentation of an exudative, crusted area that is tender to touch, along with the punch biopsy findings of solar elastosis, mild dysplasia, and a marked inflammatory reaction, are consistent with erosive pustular dermatosis. This condition is characterized by chronic, sterile pustules and erosions that typically affect sun-damaged skin, particularly on the scalp. It is often associated with a history of actinic keratoses, as seen in this patient.
